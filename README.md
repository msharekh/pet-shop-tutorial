# Setting up the development environment

```npm install -g truffle```

```
Truffle v5.5.2 (core: 5.5.2)
Ganache v7.0.1
Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
Node v16.14.0
Web3.js v1.5.3
```

# Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box

```
mkdir pet-shop-tutorial

cd pet-shop-tutorial
```
```truffle unbox pet-shop```

## Directory structureÂ¶
The default Truffle directory structure contains the following:

- `contracts`/: Contains the Solidity source files for our smart contracts. There is an important contract in here called `Migrations`.sol, which we'll talk about later.
- `migrations`/: Truffle uses a migration system to handle smart contract deployments. 

    A migration is an additional special smart contract that keeps track of changes.
- `test`/: Contains both JavaScript and Solidity tests for our smart contracts
- `truffle-config.js`: Truffle configuration file

# Writing the smart contract

- Create a new file named `Adoption.sol` in the contracts/ directory.
